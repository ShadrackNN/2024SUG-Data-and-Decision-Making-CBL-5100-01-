## In the recent assignment

We engaged in a comprehensive data management and analysis process. We began by cleaning and formatting the dataset, which involved determining the number of variables and cases, assigning unique IDs, adjusting column widths, and ensuring text clarity by wrapping and freezing header rows. We then applied conditional formatting to highlight specific cases, such as marking all "Female" entries in green. The sorting task required us to organize data based on respondents’ marital status while maintaining data integrity across rows. We addressed errors in date formatting and converted text-based duration data into numerical values for analysis. Specifically, we translated descriptive time ranges into numerical representations for quantitative analyses. Finally, we utilized statistical functions to calculate the median and mode of various variables, setting the stage for more in-depth analysis and decision-making. This thorough approach not only streamlined the data but also prepared it for insightful analysis and effective decision-making.
